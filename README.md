The project is a simple Unity 3D game started as a personal hobby project that aims to make the player follow through the events that occured during the battle of Nalapani. 
To do this we first go through the design processes for both the scene and players.


### Design

The following design are created for the game. The major scenes include following
A main scene with the fort is created using free assets and modeled with a shape that resembles the real-life fort as much as possible based on the available resources

And a second scene is a vast terrain that consists of a small village and some forest areas. The village is made to look as much like a traditional Nepali-style house and building and different assets were used to populate the area, including trees, and grass.

### Characters
A simple model was created in Blender to represent Balbhadra Kunwar, then we used it as a base for other models in the game. Amar Singh Thapa and the soldiers were created by modifying the original model to fit their respective roles.

> **Note:** The game is still work in progress.... Only the basic player mechanics and design have been completed.
